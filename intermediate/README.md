```

### Key Components

#### 1. **Model Inheritance Hierarchy**
```python
BaseEmployee              # Common fields and validation
├── EmployeeCreate       # For creating new employees
├── EmployeeUpdate       # For updating existing employees
└── Employee             # Full model with database fields
```

#### 2. **Database Integration Pattern**
```python
# Pydantic model (validation)
class EmployeeCreate(BaseModel):
    name: str = Field(min_length=2)
    email: EmailStr

# SQLAlchemy model (persistence) 
class EmployeeTable(Base):
    name = Column(String(50), nullable=False)
    email = Column(String(255), unique=True)
```

## 💡 Key Learning Concepts

### 1. Pydantic + SQLAlchemy Integration
```python
# Step 1: Validate with Pydantic
employee_data = EmployeeCreate(**form_data)

# Step 2: Create SQLAlchemy instance
db_employee = EmployeeTable(**employee_data.model_dump())

# Step 3: Save to database
session.add(db_employee)
session.commit()
```

### 2. Database Session Management
```python
@contextmanager
def session_scope():
    session = SessionLocal()
    try:
        yield session
        session.commit()
    except Exception:
        session.rollback()
        raise
    finally:
        session.close()
```

### 3. Model Inheritance for DRY Code
```python
class BaseEmployee(BaseModel):
    # Common fields shared by all employee models
    first_name: str = Field(min_length=2)
    last_name: str = Field(min_length=2)
    # ... shared validation logic

class EmployeeCreate(BaseEmployee):
    # Additional fields specific to creation
    # Inherits all BaseEmployee validation

class Employee(BaseEmployee):
    # Full model with database fields
    id: Optional[int] = None
    created_at: Optional[datetime] = None
```

### 4. Cross-field Validation
```python
@model_validator(mode='after')
def validate_age_at_hire(self):
    """Ensure employee was old enough when hired."""
    if self.birth_date and self.hire_date:
        age_at_hire = calculate_age(self.birth_date, self.hire_date)
        if age_at_hire < 16:
            raise ValueError('Employee was too young at hire date')
    return self
```

## 🎓 Learning Exercises

### Exercise 1: Database Operations
1. Add several employees using the form
2. Observe the automatic employee ID generation
3. Check the database file created in the `data/` directory
4. Use the database management tools to reset and reinitialize

### Exercise 2: Model Inheritance
1. Examine the `BaseEmployee` class in `models/employee.py`
2. See how `EmployeeCreate` inherits shared validation
3. Compare with the `Employee` model (full database model)
4. Try modifying a validator and see it affect all inherited models

### Exercise 3: Database Sessions
1. Look at the `session_scope()` context manager in `connection.py`
2. See how it handles commit/rollback automatically
3. Try causing an error during employee creation
4. Observe how the transaction rolls back properly

### Exercise 4: Cross-field Validation
1. Try adding an employee with a birth date that makes them too young at hiring
2. See the cross-field validation in action
3. Modify the validation logic in `EmployeeCreate`
4. Test different scenarios (future hire dates, etc.)

## 🔧 Database Management

### SQLite Database
The application uses SQLite for simplicity. The database file is automatically created at `intermediate/data/employees.db`.

### Key Database Operations
- **Create Tables**: Automatic on first run
- **Sample Data**: Initialize with realistic test data
- **Reset**: Drop and recreate tables
- **Backup**: Simply copy the `.db` file

### Connection Management
```python
# Get database manager (singleton pattern)
db = get_database_manager()

# Use session context manager
with db.session_scope() as session:
    employees = session.query(EmployeeTable).all()
    # Automatic commit and cleanup
```

## 📊 Analytics Features

### Dashboard Metrics
- Total and active employee counts
- Average salary calculations
- Department distribution
- Total payroll summation

### Visualizations
- Interactive pie charts (Plotly)
- Department breakdowns
- Real-time data updates

## 🚧 Common Issues & Solutions

### **Import Errors**
Make sure you're running from the `intermediate/` directory:
```bash
cd intermediate
streamlit run app.py
```

### **Database Connection Issues**
- Check that the `data/` directory is writable
- Use "Recreate Tables" if schema changes
- Initialize sample data if database is empty

### **Validation Errors**
These are educational! Read the error messages to understand:
- Which field failed validation
- What the constraint was (min_length, email format, etc.)
- How to fix the input

## 📈 Performance Considerations
